##### <span>01.</span> About me

Upbeat personality, highly skilled Analyst Programmer with over eight years of experience driving new technologies to enhance company systems with Java Programming Language. Confident in the ability to develop RESTful API and Spring Boot services, with solid knowledge of Python programming with NoSQL and MySQL models, backend with Node.js, PHP, and Java. Comfortable with C++, React, and React Native programming skills. Track record of mentoring colleagues to enhance their PHP, Objective-C, Swift, and shell scripting skills.

##### <span>02.</span> Interests and Hobbies

I m a passionate seasonal photographer with a keen eye for capturing stunning landscapes and unforgettable moments as I travel around the world. My love for photography goes hand in hand with my daily training as a swimmer. I am dedicated to improving my skills in the pool and typically swim around 4,000 meters each day, tracking my progress with my Apple Watch.

In addition to my artistic pursuits, I have a deep fascination with aviation and often find inspiration in the beauty of flight. Traveling allows me to connect with diverse cultures and environments, which enriches both my photography and my overall experience. Whether I'm exploring a new destination or pushing my limits in the water, I relish every opportunity to learn and grow.
##### <span>03.</span> Framework Preferences

I have a passion for developing my own frameworks, as it allows me to tailor solutions to specific needs and challenges. In addition to my personal projects, I also enjoy working with popular frameworks that are widely used in the software development industry. For instance, I appreciate the versatility of Laravel when working with PHP, which helps streamline web application development.

I'm also skilled in using React for building engaging user interfaces, and I leverage Node.js with JavaScript for efficient server-side programming. Furthermore, I utilize Firebase from Google for real-time database management and authentication, which enhances the performance of applications. Finally, I have experience integrating payment processing systems, particularly with Stripe, to facilitate secure transactions in web and mobile applications. This combination of skills allows me to create robust and user-friendly applications.
