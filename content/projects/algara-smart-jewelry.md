### Color Match Your Jewelry

All you have to do is take a photo with the ALGARA Mobile App on your smartphone device. Define the color you love (in the photo) and the stone core changes to that exact color in real-time.

### Infinite Possibilities, Powerful Customizations

Fashion is creativity, and the creativity of ALGARA is inspired by you. This is why unlike any other wearable technology out there, we’ve customized ALGARA to become your personal reflection of style.

Taking photos on a smartphone is such an integral part of our lifestyle today, so why not change the way you look with each photo you take?

In just a few seconds, the color of the White Jade core can be customized by syncing it to any color from a photo or outfit. What’s left is to pick the right jewelry accessory to “swap and snap” to the smart stone core.

Forget about messing around with cables when you can enjoy the ease of wirelessly charging anytime, anywhere and automatically via Bluetooth. Every ALGARA system comes with its own wireless power charger and USB cable. Simply connect the charger to a power source, pop out the stone core from the O-Mount casing and place it on the inductive charger. The stone core will be fully charged overnight or if you prefer, set your ALGARA to charge wirelessly while still wearing it.
