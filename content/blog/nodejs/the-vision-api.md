In the sprawling digital cosmos where data reigns supreme, Vision AI emerges as the intrepid explorer, navigating through the vast fields of visual information with the precision of a cybernetic cartographer. This isn't just your run-of-the-mill tech; it's the future of seeing, equipped with an API as versatile and potent as a Swiss Army knife in the hands of a gadget-obsessed spy. With Vision AI, developers can now harness the power to analyze, interpret, and interact with the visual world in ways that were once the stuff of sci-fi fantasies. Whether you're looking to build apps that can identify species of plants, read emotions, or even assist the visually impaired, the API for Vision AI is your gateway to a universe of possibilities.

### Quickstart

Following is the API demo,

  ```js  {curl} showLineNumbers
  curl https://api.awoz.co/vision \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
  -d "{
    "name": "oskar",
    "value": "what is mad men"
    "imageurl": "https://youimg.com/img.png"
  }"

  ```

API Response:
  ```js  {curl} showLineNumbers
    {
      "message": "Uploaded successfully",
      "url": "https://awozcdn.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1733108231969-658A6381.jpg",
      "answer": "The image depicts a close-up view of the moon against a black background. The moon appears in a phase where it is partially illuminated, showing a mix of lighter and darker areas that reveal its surface features, such as craters and maria. The overall color of the moon is a warm tone, likely due to atmospheric conditions during the photograph's capture.\n\nThere are no people in the image, and I cannot access EXIF data or any details about the capture settings. If you have any specific questions about the moon or photography, feel free to ask!"
    }
  ```
