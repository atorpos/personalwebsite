Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Using Markdown is different than using a WYSIWYG editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately. Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file, you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and phrases should look different.

### I was interviewed by Local news media

During my visit to the Starship Flight 6 launch, I had the opportunity to participate in an interview with a local news media outlet. The experience was both exciting and insightful as the journalists asked me about my thoughts on the launch and its significance in the field of space exploration. It was a remarkable day filled with anticipation, and I was thrilled to share my perspective on this groundbreaking event with the audience.

### The launch video

Test 6 is awesome, but too shame, the booster landed on sea rather than the tower
